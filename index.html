                    In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web, an Internet-based hypermedia initiative for global information sharing while at CERN, the European Particle Physics Laboratory. <br> He wrote the first web client and server in 1990. <br> His specifications of URIs, HTTP and HTML were refined as web technology spread.
                    He is a senior researcher and holder of the 3Com founder's chair at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). <br> He is a director of the Web Science Research Initiative (WSRI) and a member of the advisory board of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence.
                    Background Tim Berners-Lee (also known as “TimBL”) was born on June 8, 1955 in London, England. <br> His parents are mathematicians, Conway Berners-Lee and Mary Lee Woods. <br> He is best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web but he has also been the first person to successfully implement communication between a host server and a Hypertext Transfer Protocol client through the internet sometime in November of 1989. <br> He was working at CERN (a large particle physics laboratory near Geneva Switzerland) as a software engineer. 
                    His ultimate vision was to see millions of computers connected across the world though a single universal system rather than sharing results via mail or very specific communication systems. <br> For example, the Internet was originally developed by the United States military during the Cold War as a new form of communication but was only thought of as a form of communication within the United States. <br> To practically everyone else on the planet, the Internet was useless to them until the World Wide Web was created.
